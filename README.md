# Spring Boot User Admin Rest Service

### How to build and start the application?
```
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl webservice
```
Launch as compiled jar
```
mvn clean install
java -jar webservice/target/webservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Api Documentation
```
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/
```

### Testing

3 levels of testing we have: 
- unit tests
- integration test (SpringBootTest executed during the service build)
- standalone E2E tests (executed during build time against a dockerised instancestarted locally, and can be executed in standalone mode on service deployed to environments (prod - just placeholder atm)

Run E2E tests only
```
mvn clean test -pl standalone-e2e-test -DskipTests=false
```
By default it runs against localhost:8080, but you can override it with -P<env> setting (maven profile) 
```
mvn clean test -pl standalone-e2e-test -Pprod
```
options:
-Pdev -> http://localhost:8080/  (default)

-Pprod -> http://prod:8080/

Run a single test class: -Dtest=SwaggerEndpointTest

### Todo: 
bump spring-boot-starter-parent to latest - that means need to bump to swagger 3 (openapi)
